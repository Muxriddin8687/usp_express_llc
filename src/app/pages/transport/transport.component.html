                <h2 class="blog-title">Open Auto Transport</h2>
                <div class="card-text">With open transport, your car is usually shipped on a long, two-level trailer. Open transport is suitable for any type of vehicle and is the best choice if you want to ship a standard model or a used car. They are usually open 8 or 10-car haulers. They are the same type of trailers used to to deliver new cars to your local dealerships. This type of car shipment is the most popularly requested here at USP Express LLC. (It’s our bread and butter) We use a modern fleet of open car carriers operated by skilled drivers that will carry your vehicle with the highest care and professionalism.</div>

                <div class="card-text">With enclosed transport, your vehicle is shipped in a fully enclosed trailer. This offers a higher degree of security and protection for your vehicle. Enclosed transport is often the chosen shipping method for owners who wish to move a new car, an antique, a collectible, or an expensive vehicle. Only a few vehicles (up to 7 automobiles at most) can be transported using this method at a time. This method also may be 30-40% more expensive compared to open auto transportation.</div>
